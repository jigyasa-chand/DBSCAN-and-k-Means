# DBSCAN-and-k-Means
density-based clustering algorithm


DBSCAN, as we know, is a density-based clustering algorithm. In this problem, we implemented our own DBSCAN algorithm.

Used the Kmeans clustering algorithm from sklearn and found the number of clusters in dataset1 shared. Plotted the data points with different colors for different
clusters.

Used both DBSCAN and k-means on dataset2.
